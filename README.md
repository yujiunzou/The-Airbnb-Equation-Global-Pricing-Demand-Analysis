# The-AirBnB-Equation  
## Airbnb Pricing & Review Analysis: NYC vs London

---

## Project Overview
Airbnb is one of the world’s largest platforms for short-term vacation rentals. As the number of listings grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for guests to choose suitable accommodations and for hosts to compete effectively.

This project analyzes Airbnb booking and hosting activity across different locations to understand what drives pricing, demand, and guest satisfaction. We focus on two major global travel destinations: **New York City** and **London**.

---

## Motivation
As frequent travelers, we often question whether an Airbnb booking is worth the price or risk. This motivated us to explore what makes certain listings more successful than others.

By identifying the key drivers behind pricing, demand, and reviews, this analysis aims to help hosts make better business decisions and help guests better evaluate listings.
